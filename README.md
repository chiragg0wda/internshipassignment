Column sorting with ascending and descending order

Row selection with single or multiple checkbox options

Loading and empty states for better user experience

Semantic and accessible HTML table structure that supports keyboard navigation

Fully responsive design that works well across devices

Development Approach
I structured this project to be scalable and maintainable from the ground up, focusing on clean component design and reusable logic. I leveraged AI tools as a pair programmer to accelerate initial setup and component scaffolding, but all code has been thoroughly reviewed, tested, and customized by me. Accessibility, responsiveness, and theming were key focuses throughout development.
